A Google Chrome extension that will redirect the browser back to the Google Form after it's been submitted

Motivation:  We have a Google Form used as a sign-in log for people entering the office.  The browser is running in Kiosk mode, but Google Forms displays a response page after the form is submitted and we needed it to automatically go back to the original form to wait for the next visitor.

This extension will display the response page and wait four seconds before redirecting back to the original form
